# Wilson-Cowan Model Dynamics

## Project Overview

This project explores the dynamics of the Wilson-Cowan model, a mathematical framework for studying interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neural populations. The goal is to understand how changes in model parameters influence neural activity patterns such as steady states, oscillations, and transient responses.

## Features and Methodology
- Implementation: Simulated and analyzed the Wilson-Cowan model using a Jupyter Notebook.
- Core Functions:
  - Nullclines and Steady States: Identified equilibrium points through root-finding algorithms.
  - Critical Point Classification: Assessed stability of fixed points using eigenvalue analysis.
  - Non-linearity Modifications: Analyzed the effects of varying gain and threshold values on system dynamics.
  - Connection Strength Variations: Explored the impact of altered excitatory and inhibitory connection strengths.
  - External Stimuli: Studied system responses under mild, strong, and unbalanced external drives.

## Key Results
- Parameter Sensitivity: Changes in gain, thresholds, and connection strengths significantly affect system stability and activity patterns.
- External Inputs: Mild drives create stable equilibria, while strong or unbalanced inputs can lead to dynamic or saturated behaviors.
- Neural Dynamics: The model effectively demonstrates how feedback mechanisms between populations shape activity.
